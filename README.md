# Ironclad MASH Stack

This project is an exploration of the MASH stack in Rust, inspired by [Evan Schwartz's guide](https://emschwartz.me/building-a-fast-website-with-the-mash-stack-in-rust/). The goal is to combine the best practices for building fast, secure, and maintainable web applications using Rust.

By leveraging "supersafe Rust" principles, this project aims to enforce stricter safety and security measures, ensuring robust and reliable code while maintaining high performance.
